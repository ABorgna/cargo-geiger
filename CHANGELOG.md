# Changelog
---------

## 0.11.0
 - (TODO: Merge) Add build without lock file to CI. [#183]
 - Feature: safety report in readme. [#151]
 - TODO: Document all relevant changes here.

## 0.10.2
 - __Bugfix__: Avoid panic and log warnings on parse failure. [#105]
 - Upgraded all dependencies.

## 0.10.1
 - Expose the `cargo` crate feature: `vendored-openssl`. [#99]
 - Upgraded all dependencies.

## 0.10.0
 - Upgraded all dependencies. [#98]

## 0.9.1
 - __Bugfix__: Avoid counting the same crate multiple times. [#79]
 - Upgraded cargo to 0.41. [#85]
 - Upgraded all dependencies.

## 0.9.0
 - __Breaking change__: Replaced structopt & clap with [pico-args], to reduce 
   compile times [#77]. As a result the `-Z` flag now requires quotes around
   its list of sub arguments, other than that there should be no changes to 
   the CLI.

## 0.8.0
 - __Bugfix:__ Count all expressions in unsafe functions and nested unsafe
   scopes, in [geiger 0.4.1](geiger), [#72] & [#71].
 - __Bugfix:__ Properly account for possibly patched dependencies [#70].
 - Summary for each metrics column, [#76].
 - Now requires all entry points for a crate to declare
   `#[forbid(unsafe_code)]` for it to count as crate-wide.
 - New optional scan mode `--forbid-only`. This mode doesn't require any calls
   to `rustc` and only requires parsing the entry point `.rs` files, making it
   much faster than the normal mode.
 - Updated dependencies.

## 0.7.3
 - __Bugfix:__ Fix dependency collection for mixed workspaces [#66].
 - Updated dependencies.

## 0.7.2
 - Updated dependencies to fix [#59].

## 0.7.1
 - __Bugfix:__ related to attributes, in [geiger] [#57].
 - Updated all dependencies.

## 0.7.0
 - Updated all dependencies, [geiger] to 0.3.0.

## 0.6.1
 - A tiny readme fix.

## 0.6.0
 - There are now three crate scanning result variants [#52]:
   - üîí No unsafe usage found and all build target entry point `.rs` source
     files, used by the build, declare `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. Crates like
     this will be printed in green.
   - ‚ùì No unsafe usage found, but at least one build target entry point `.rs`
     file, used by the build, does not declare `#[forbid(unsafe_code)]`.  Crates
     like this will be printed in the default terminal foreground color.
   - ‚ò¢Ô∏è  Unsafe usage found. Crates like this will be printed in red, same as in
     the previous version.

## 0.5.0
 - Moved reusable parts, decoupled from `cargo`, to the new crate
   [geiger]. Main github issue: [#30].
 - Some general refactoring and cleanup.
 - Merge pull request [#46] from alexmaco/dependency_kind_control. add options
   to filter dependencies by kind; defaults to Kind::Normal.
 - Merge pull request [#40] from jiminhsieh/rust-2018. Use Rust 2018 edition.

## 0.4.2
 - __Bugfix:__ Merge pull request [#33] from ajpaverd/windows_filepaths.
   Canonicalize file paths from walker.

 - Merge pull request [#38] from anderejd/updated-deps. Updated deps and fixed
   build errors.

## 0.4.1
 - Merge pull request [#28] from alexmaco/deps_upgrade. fix build on rust 1.30:
   upgrade petgraph to 0.4.13

 - __Bugfix:__ Merge pull request [#29] from alexmaco/invalid_utf8_source. fix 
   handling source files with invalid utf8: lossy conversion to string

## 0.4.0
 - Filters out tests by default. Tests can still be included by using
   `--include-tests`. The test code is filtered out by looking for the attribute
   `#[test]` on functions and `#[cfg(test)]` on modules.

## 0.3.1
 - __Bugfix:__ Some bugfixes related to cargo workspace path handling.
 - Slightly better error messages in some cases.

## 0.3.0
 - Intercepts `rustc` calls and reads the `.d` files generated by `rustc` to
   identify which `.rs` files are used by the build. This allows a crate that
   contains `.rs` files with unsafe code usage to pass as "green" if the unsafe
   code isn't used by the build.
 - Each metric is now printed as `x/y`, where `x` is the unsafe code used by the
   build and `y` is the total unsafe usage found in the crate.
 - Removed the `--compact` output format to avoid some code complexity. A new
   and better compact mode can be added later if requested.

## 0.2.0
 - Table based output format [#9].

## 0.1.x
 - Initial experimental versions.
 - Mostly README.md updates.
